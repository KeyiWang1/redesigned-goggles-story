Once upon a time, there's a student at UW-Madison named Keyi. She's in CS major and all the courses are so difficult that she cried every night trying to finish the HW.
She believes that everything will be fine.
She has to or she will eventually dissolve from the tears. The clock's gentle /Tick-Tock/ and the rhythmic clacking of the computers keys are all that can be mark the passing hours. The tear tracks dried, the computer closed, the code compiled, and the sun begins to rise.
She is very pretty and is hardworking. She is really to make her parents proud someday!
